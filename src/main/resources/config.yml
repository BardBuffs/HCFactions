# Debug
# Turn this on if you are having issues with something and working on resolving them.
# This will spam your console with information that is useful if you know how to read the source.
# It's suggested that you only turn this on at the direction of a developer.
debug: false

# Prevent find factions exploit
# This will help limit how many times a player can be sent a map of factions.
# Set this to the cooldown you want, in miliseconds, for a map to be shown to a player.
# If you want to log when a player violates this (only happens on chunk enter so it shouldn't be too spammy),
#   set log to true and it will be logged to console as "player tried to show a faction map too soon and triggered exploit blocker."
findfactionsexploit:
  cooldown: 2000 # in miliseconds. 2000 = 2 seconds.
  log: false

# Default Relation allows you to change the default relation for Factions.
# Example usage would be so people can't leave then make a new Faction while Raiding
#   in order to be able to execute commands if the default relation is neutral.
# This has always been neutral.
default-relation: "neutral"

# Portal Creation
# Do you want to limit portal creation?
portals:
  limit: false # will disable the below check if set to false

  # What should the minimum relation be to create a portal in territory?
  # Goes in the order of: ENEMY, NEUTRAL, ALLY, MEMBER.
  # Minimum relation allows that and all listed to the right to create portals.
  # Example: put ALLY to allow ALLY and MEMBER to be able to create portals.
  minimum-relation: MEMBER # If typed incorrectly, defaults to NEUTRAL.

# Warps
# What should be the max amount of warps that a Factoin can set?
max-warps: 5

# This is the cost section for warps.
# It will charge them each time the command would be successful. (won't charge on erroneous /f warp attempts).
# You can use decimal places here.
# If enabled is set to false, it will ignore the values.
warp-cost:
  enabled: false
  setwarp: 5.0
  delwarp: 5.0
  warp: 5.0

# Pistons
# Should we disable pistons in Faction territory? This will prevent people from doing something like:

# ToolTips
# This section is to configure tooltips for things like /f list
tooltips:

  # List
  # This shows up when someone does /f list for the top factions.
  # It will not sure up for factionless of course, just actual factions.
  # You can use color codes here.

    - "&6Members: &f{online}/{members}"

  # Show
  # This shows up when someone does /f show.
  # It adds tooltips to each player in the list here, nothing else.
  # {group} will show the players primary group if you have vault installed.
  # {balance} will show their balance if you have vault installed.
  # {lastSeen} will show human readable info on when the player was last seen, or online.

    - "&6Balance: &a${balance}"

# Configuration section for Scoreboards
# This will allow you to completely customize how your scoreboards look.
# Make sure that no lines are duplicates of each other otherwise only the first will display.
# Use &0-9a-f for colors and include messages in "quotes"
scoreboard:

# How long do we want scoreboards to stay if set temporarily.
  expiration: 7

# FInfo scoreboard is displayed when a player walks into a new Faction's territory.
# Scoreboard disappears after <expiration> seconds.
# Things to be replaced in this:
# {name} - viewer name. {balance} - viewer balance. {faction} faction tag (FYI: title of board is already faction tag)
# {dtr} - Factions current DTR. {maxdtr} - Max DTR that faction can have
# {land} - total claimed land (in chunks). {maxland} - how much land a faction can claim
# {members} - total members. {online} - online members. {leader} - faction's leader.
# {raidable} - true if the faction can be claimed over, otherwise false.
# {warps} - the number of warps that a faction has set. {totalOnline} - # of online players
# The title of the scoreboard will be the Faction's tag and colored according to the relation with the player's Faction.
# Commenting this section out will cause the info to appear in chat as the plugin originally did.

# Max Relation Types
# Limits factions to having a max number of each relation.
# Setting to 0 means none allowed. -1 for disabled.
# This will have no effect on default or existing relations, only when relations are changed.

# WorldBorder support 
# A buffer of 0 means faction claims can go right up to the border of the world.

# the border of the world and what can be claimed to factions

  # Buffer Zone
  # Buffer Zone is an chunk area required between claims of different Factions.
  # This is default to 0 and has always been that way. Meaning Factions can have
  #   claims that border each other.
  # If this is set to 3, then Factions need to have 3 chunks between their claim
  #   and another Faction's claim.
  # It's recommended to keep this pretty low as the radius check could be a
  #   heavy operation if set to a large number.
  # If this is set to 0, we won't even bother checking which is how Factions has
  #   always been.
